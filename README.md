# Assignment FLOXX Meetings trainee

## Assignment

Hello! Welcome to the assignment for FLOXX Meetings. Your task for this assignment is to make the navigation bar of the FLOXX Meetings webpage. The design is already made and can be found on the AdobeXD page [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/5e9c2160-1380-4a6d-bf62-97ab085dd06b-0bcf/screen/ec6576fc-d080-466e-bb18-fe0a07a138cb/). The to be used assets, colors, and character styles can be found on the page as well. Your job is to replicate this design to the best of your abilities. Besides replicating the navigation bar, we ask you to retrieve the name of the user and the names of the pages in the navigation bar by using an API-call to the API. This API is already made and only an axios GET call is required to "/navigation/get_navigationbar_info" to get this information. Furthermore, the 'Jaar-planning' and 'Agenda' button should redirect the user to a new page and the 'Uitloggen' button should only give a temporarily pop-up, leaving the user on the current page.
Good luck, with the assignment!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

In the ./server directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the dependencies necessary to run the application.

### `npm start`

Runs the front-end of the application (can be found on localhost:3000).

### `node ./bin/www`

Use this command in the 'server' directory to start the API, so queries can be made to it (use a second command prompt for this).
