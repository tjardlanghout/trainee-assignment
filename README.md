# Assignment FLOXX Meetings trainee

## Assignment

Hello! Welcome to the assignment for FLOXX Meetings. Your task is to replicate the navigation bar of the FLOXX Meetings webpage. The design you'll have to replicate can be found on the AdobeXD page [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/5e9c2160-1380-4a6d-bf62-97ab085dd06b-0bcf/screen/ec6576fc-d080-466e-bb18-fe0a07a138cb/). The to be used assets, colors, and character styles can be found on the page as well (by clicking the '</>' on the right size of the page). It is your job to replicate this design to the best of your abilities. Besides replicating the navigation bar, we ask you to retrieve the name of the user and the names of the pages in the navigation bar by using an API-call. This API is already made and only an axios GET call is required (to "/navigation/get_navigationbar_info"). Furthermore, the 'Jaar-planning' and 'Agenda' button should redirect the user to a new page and the 'Uitloggen' button should only give a temporarily pop-up, leaving the user on the current page. We ask you to keep track of the time spent for the assignment and encountered obstacles (if there are any). We hope you are able to finish the assignment before the meeting at the office, otherwise we would still like to see how far you have gotten (so please take your laptop with you for the meeting or upload your code). If you have questions or troubles with the template of the assignment, feel free to contact us through mail to minimize unnecessary time loss on your side.

Good luck with the assignment!

----

In the ./server directory, you can run:
